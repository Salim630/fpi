The triokeyword(VDF)
The triokeyword(hysteresis) enables the definition of a range of acceptable values for the contact angle. 
If the actual contact angle is outside this range, the closest bound is used instead for the computation 
of curvature at the contact line. In that case, curvature differences will appear between the line and the 
interior of the domain. As a result, forces will arise from surface tension effects and the fluid will be 
put into motion in the vincinity of the contact line.
