	Title "Description of the case"
	Description "A water drop is present at the upper frontier of a closed box. Despite the presence of gravity effects, its position can be maintained hanged close to a solid wall, by the action of surface tension forces. Phenomena related to the contact angle close to the solid wall play an important role. The contact angle is the angle between the surface where is hanged the drop and the tangent at the meridians of the drop close to thesolid wall. It is measured on the external face of the drop. Its value leads to the determination of the amount of water that can be present in the drop, before it falls. The present test case is useful to analyse the way the surface tension forces are taken into account in the presence of contact angle. An emphasis is lain on the importance of parasitic currents. During the calculation, the bubble grows due to low velocity water injection. Water is injected at the center of the drop, via a boundary condition located in the wall. The surface involved in the boundary condition is much lower than the surface wettet by the drop. At the beginning of the process, the volume of the drop has a small value. Its shape tends to be a part of a sphere. Thereafter, it changes, due to hydrostatic pressure. The computationally obtained profile of the drop is compared to an analytical reference solution. Its shape is supposed to follow a cylindrical symetry. It is given by the integration of the following equation :" 	
	Description "\latex_($$ -\frac{\partial \theta }{\partial s} - \frac{\sin \theta}{x}\ =\ \frac{g\left(\rho_{l} - \rho_{g}\right)}{\sigma}\left( y - y_{0}\right)$$\latex_)."
	Description "The parameter \latex_($y_{0}$\latex_) is determinated so that the contact angle at the top frontier keeps a fixed, constant, given value. The entire profile of the drop is determined via a classical iteration Runge-Kutta method. In figure 1.1 to 1.5, we show theoretical profiles of a water drop in air, for different sizes, i.e for different amounts of water involved in it. Different contact angles with solid wall are also presented. The numerical accuracy is satisfactory, since the curvature and the contact angle are second order calculated."
	Description "In TRUST calculations, one can notice that the accuracy does not depend on the eulerian mesh only : the equilibrium profile is fully determinated via the geometrical curvature of interfaces and the gravity potentiel, which is evaluated at the interfacial nodes. It does not depend on discretised quantities related to the fixed mesh. As one can see in the figures of the patterns 2, 3, 4, 5, which show the growth of the drop and the profile of its shape, that parasitic currents do not play an important role. Comparing figures 3 and 5, one can notice that for low values of contact angle, the profile is less stable in time. Some spurious oscillations of the interface take place."
